# Internationalization

Justice.cool has a strong support for the following languages:

- English
- French

Which means that our website, and all the mail templates we use will be translated to one of those languages based on who the user is.


We will add strong support for other languages in the future. However, Justice.cool has also a *weak* support of all major languages.
Which means that when your opponent writes a message, say, in Chinese, we will automatically translate it to your prefered language.

Thankfully to this, you can start mediations with parties with which you share no common language.

?> You can change your prefered language in [your company account settings](https://app.justice.cool/account/corporate)

## Get API call results in the right language

When using our GraphQL API, you will notice that some properties have the type `LocalizedString`.
All those are strings, which will be translated in the language of your choice based on the `Accept-Language` http header value you provide when calling our API.

By default, English will be chosen.

## Specify my opponent language

In most of the cases, Justice.cool will be able to guess which language to use when contacting your opponent.

However, you can force which language to use by filling the `OpponentInput.language` property when creating a dispute.
