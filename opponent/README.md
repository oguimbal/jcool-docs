# Who is it for ?

This tutorial is for opponent companies who would like to handle more efficiently their disputes on jcool.


## Notification when a new file is created

To get a notification when a new dispute against your company is created through justice.cool, you have to implement the `newDispute` hook. See [API hooks](general/hooks.md) for more information.

In the same way, you can configure any other hook (EX: a message has been received, a mediation has failed etc). The list of the API hooks is available in your user area, in the [developer tab](https://app.staging.justice.cool/fr/dev/api).


## Mediation

The negociation sequence inside the mediation process works exactly the same way for demanders and opponents.

You can find more information on negociation in the [mediation tutorial](/mediation/negociation/intro.md).
